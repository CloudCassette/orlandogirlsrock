## Who We Are

We help girls, non-binary youth, and women build self-esteem through music creation and performance, provide music and art-based workshops, and create leadership opportunities for teens and women by cultivating a supportive community of peers and mentors that encourage social change and the development of life skills.

## Our Values

At Orlando Girls Rock Camp we aim to create a safer and inclusive environment for campers and volunteers. For this reason, we do not discriminate against individuals on the basis of race/ethnicity, class, ability, religion, immigration status, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

Our goal is for camp to be fun and safe for any and all campers and volunteers. OGRC believes in gender self-determination and our camp is open to girls, women, gender non-conforming individuals, and is trans-inclusive.
